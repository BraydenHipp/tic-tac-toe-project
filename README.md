# tic-tac-toe-project
This is my first project that I'm uploading to github. It's not much but I'm proud of it. All code written by me.
It's just a standard tic tac toe game that displays the game in the terminal.
It's made for two players.
It coumts each player's wins and you can decide to end the game or play again after each game.
